## Context

The user has provided the following information:

**Product/Service Name:** {{PRODUCT_NAME}}

**Customer Type:** {{CUSTOMER_TYPE}}

**Problem Being Solved:** {{PROBLEM}}

**Desired Outcome:** {{OUTCOME}}

**Proof Points/Results:** {{PROOF_POINTS}}

**Key Differentiators:** {{DIFFERENTIATORS}}

**Common Objections to Address:** {{OBJECTIONS}}

## Your Task

Create a compelling power statement that follows the proven structure: who you work with, what problem you solve, and why they should care.

### Power Statement Structure

A power statement should:

1. **Identify the customer type** - Be specific about who you serve
2. **Name the problem** - State the pain point in terms prospects recognize
3. **Highlight the outcome** - Focus on results, not features
4. **Provide credibility** - Include proof points that build trust
5. **Address objections** - Preemptively handle common concerns
6. **Use plain language** - Avoid jargon and technical terms

### Format Options

Create TWO versions:

**Version A: Concise (Single Paragraph)**
A tight, 3-5 sentence power statement that can be delivered in 30 seconds. This version should flow naturally as spoken language.

**Version B: Structured (Multi-Section)**
A more detailed version with clear sections:
- The Challenge You're Facing
- The Solution
- Proven Results & Immediate ROI
- Why It Works

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: AI Slop Prevention Rules

### Banned Vague Language

❌ **NEVER use these without specific quantification:**

| Banned Term | Replace With |
|-------------|--------------|
| "improve" | "increase from X to Y" |
| "enhance" | specific capability added |
| "optimize" | exact metric and improvement amount |
| "better results" | specific baseline → target |
| "significant" | exact percentage or number |

### Banned Filler Phrases

❌ **DELETE these entirely:**
- "It's worth noting that..."
- "In today's competitive landscape..."
- "Let's talk about..."
- "The reality is..."

### Banned Buzzwords

❌ **Replace with plain language:**
- leverage → use
- utilize → use
- synergy → combined benefit
- cutting-edge → (name the specific technology)
- game-changing → (quantify the change)
- revolutionary → (describe specific innovation)
- industry-leading → (cite specific ranking)

## ⚠️ SCORING RUBRIC - How Your Power Statement Will Be Evaluated

Your power statement will be scored across **4 dimensions totaling 100 points**. Understanding this rubric helps you write a more compelling statement.

### Scoring Dimensions

| Dimension | Max Points | What Gets Scored |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Clarity** | 25 pts | Plain language, conversational tone, no jargon, no buzzwords |
| **Impact** | 25 pts | Customer outcomes quantified, proof points with real numbers |
| **Action** | 25 pts | Strong action verbs, problem clearly stated, solution specific |
| **Specificity** | 25 pts | Metrics present, customer type clearly identified, concrete examples |

### Version Bonus (+2 to +5 pts)

| Format | Bonus |
|--------|-------|
| Neither Version A nor B | +0 pts (penalty noted) |
| Version A only OR Version B only | +2 pts |
| Both versions but Version B lacks structure | +3 pts |
| Both versions with all 4 Version B sections | +5 pts |

### Score Calibration

| Score Range | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| **0-40** | Incomplete - missing versions or no proof points |
| **41-55** | Weak - generic language, no quantification |
| **56-70** | Average - structure OK but lacks specific metrics |
| **71-80** | Good - solid messaging, minor jargon issues |
| **81-90** | Strong - compelling, quantified, conversational |
| **91-100** | Exceptional - sales-ready, memorable, differentiated |

- Clichés: "move the needle", "low-hanging fruit", "boil the ocean"
