# Chat Widget Feature

## Overview
We need to add a chat widget to the website. Customers have been asking for this and competitors have it. It would be really helpful for support.

## Problem
Customer support is slow and users complain. We need a better way to help them quickly. The current email-based support takes too long and users get frustrated.

## Solution
Add a chat widget that lets users talk to support agents. It should be nice looking and easy to use. We want it to be similar to what other companies have.

## Features
- Chat bubble in corner of screen
- Ability to type messages
- Support agent can respond
- Some kind of notification
- Maybe file attachments
- Mobile support would be nice

## Technical Notes
Use React for the frontend. Need to integrate with our backend somehow. Probably need WebSockets or something for real-time. Should work with our existing systems.

## Timeline
We should be able to do this in a few weeks. Need to check with engineering on exact timeline but it shouldn't be too complicated.

## Success
Users will be happier with faster support. We'll see fewer complaints and better reviews.

## Risks
- Might be harder than expected
- Could impact performance
- Agents might get overwhelmed
- Various other issues

## Questions
- What technology should we use?
- How many agents do we need?
- Should we have it on all pages?
- Lots of things to figure out
