# Integration Feature Request

## Background
We need to integrate with third-party services. Customers want to connect our product with other tools they use. This is becoming a blocker for sales.

## Why This Matters
- Customers asking for it
- Competitors have integrations
- It's a common feature request
- Would help close deals
- Improves overall value prop

## What We're Building
An integration with other services. Let users connect their accounts and sync data. Should work automatically once set up.

### Possible Integrations
- CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)
- Communication tools (Slack, Teams, etc.)
- Other relevant services
- Whatever customers need most

## High-Level Requirements
- Connect with external services
- Sync data both ways
- Handle authentication securely
- Show status of integrations
- Let users configure settings

## Benefits
Users will save time not copying data manually. Our product becomes more valuable. Stickier customers, less churn. More competitive in the market.

## Concerns
- API complexity varies
- Security implications
- Maintenance burden
- Which integrations to prioritize

## Resources
Need engineering time to build connectors. Design help for UI. Documentation for users. Support training.

## Rough Timeline
Hard to estimate without knowing scope. Could be quick for simple integrations, longer for complex ones. Start with one and learn.

## Metrics
- Number of connected integrations
- User adoption
- Time saved
- Customer feedback

## Dependencies
- External API access
- Partner agreements maybe
- Backend infrastructure
- Various other things

## Next Steps
- Research customer priorities
- Evaluate technical requirements
- Build proof of concept
- Plan full implementation
