# Reporting Dashboard PRD

## Summary
Build a reporting dashboard for our customers. They need to see their data and understand what's happening.

## Why
Customers keep asking for better reporting. Our competitors have nice dashboards. We're losing deals because of this. Sales says it's important.

## What We Need
A dashboard that shows various metrics and data. Should have charts and graphs. Users should be able to filter things. It needs to look professional and modern.

### Key Features
- Charts showing important stuff
- Ability to filter by date
- Export to PDF or something
- Different views for different users
- Real-time data (or close to it)
- Various other reporting needs

## Technical Approach
We'll probably use a charting library. Need to pull data from the database. Should integrate with existing auth. Performance needs to be good.

## Who's Using This
- Managers who want to see team performance
- Individual users checking their stats
- Admins looking at overall data
- Executives for high-level views

## Benefits
- Better visibility into data
- Faster decision making
- Improved customer satisfaction
- More professional appearance
- Competitive advantage

## Scope
We'll include the core reports customers need. Advanced features can come later. Don't want to boil the ocean. Start simple and iterate.

## Timeline
Should take about a month or so. Depends on complexity and what exactly we build. Need to discuss with team.

## Risks and Concerns
- Data might not be ready
- Performance could be an issue
- Scope creep is likely
- Resource availability uncertain
- Other priorities might come up

## Next Steps
1. Meet with stakeholders
2. Define requirements more clearly
3. Create mockups
4. Plan sprints
5. Build it
