# Performance Improvements

## Summary
The app is slow and needs to be faster. Users complain about performance and it's affecting our reputation.

## Problem Statement
Performance is not good. Pages take too long to load. Users experience lag and delays. This causes frustration and churn.

## What We Need to Do
Make the application faster. Optimize code and infrastructure. Improve user experience through better performance.

## Goals
- Make things faster
- Reduce load times
- Improve responsiveness  
- Better performance scores
- Happy users

## Approach
We'll identify bottlenecks and fix them. Use React best practices and optimize queries. Maybe add caching. Do whatever it takes to improve speed.

### Areas to Address
- Frontend rendering
- API response times
- Database queries
- Asset loading
- Various other things

## Technical Details
Probably need to profile the app. Look at React performance. Check database indexes. CDN for static assets maybe. Standard performance optimization stuff.

## Team
Engineering will lead this. Maybe need DevOps help. Product to prioritize which areas matter most.

## Timeline
This is ongoing work. Initial pass in a few weeks. Continuous improvement after that. Performance is never "done."

## Success
- Faster page loads
- Better metrics
- Fewer complaints
- Improved satisfaction

## Risks
- Breaking things while optimizing
- Not knowing what's actually slow
- Resource constraints
- Other priorities

## Questions
- What's our performance baseline?
- What's acceptable performance?
- How do we measure improvement?
- Many unknowns here
