# Mobile Optimization Project

## Introduction
Our mobile experience needs improvement. Users on phones have trouble using the app. We need to make it work better on mobile devices.

## The Problem
The website doesn't work well on mobile. Things are too small, hard to click, slow to load. Mobile users complain a lot. Analytics show mobile conversion is much lower than desktop.

## Goals
- Make mobile experience better
- Improve mobile conversion
- Reduce mobile bounce rate
- Make users happier
- Match competitor mobile quality

## Proposed Solution
Optimize the website for mobile devices. Make buttons bigger, improve load times, fix the navigation. Generally make it more mobile-friendly.

### Things to Fix
- Navigation menu
- Forms and inputs
- Images and media
- Page load speed
- Touch targets
- Various UI elements
- Other mobile issues

## User Impact
Mobile users will have a much better experience. They'll be able to use the site properly. Conversion should improve significantly.

## Requirements
Must work on all major mobile browsers. Should look good on different screen sizes. Needs to be fast. Shouldn't break existing desktop experience.

## Technical Considerations
Responsive design using CSS. Maybe need some JavaScript changes. Image optimization probably needed. Could use lazy loading.

## Resources Needed
- Frontend developer(s)
- Designer for mobile layouts
- QA for testing
- Maybe some backend work

## Timeline
Probably 2-3 weeks for initial improvements. More time for complete optimization. Phased approach makes sense.

## Success Criteria
- Mobile conversion improves
- Fewer complaints
- Better performance scores
- Positive user feedback

## Open Items
- Which pages to prioritize?
- What about the app vs mobile web?
- How much time can we spend?
- Many things TBD
