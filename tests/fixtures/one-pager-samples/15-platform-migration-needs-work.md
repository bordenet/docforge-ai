# Platform Migration Proposal

## Introduction
We should migrate to a new platform. Our current platform has limitations that are holding us back. A migration would solve these problems and set us up for the future.

## Issues with Current Platform
- It's slow
- Hard to scale
- Difficult to maintain
- Uses old technology
- Developers don't like working with it

## Proposed New Platform
We should move to a modern platform that uses:
- Microservices
- Containers
- Cloud-native technologies
- Modern frameworks

This would make everything better.

## Benefits
The new platform would be:
- Faster
- More scalable
- Easier to maintain
- More attractive to developers

## Implementation
The migration would involve:
1. Design new architecture
2. Build new platform
3. Migrate data and services
4. Test thoroughly
5. Cut over

## Effort Estimate
This is a major undertaking. It could take a year or more and require significant engineering resources. Exact estimates are difficult without more detailed planning.

## Team
Engineering team would lead this with support from operations. May need to bring in contractors.

## Risks
- Migrations are risky
- Could take longer than expected
- May disrupt current operations
- Cost overruns possible

## Recommendation
Start with a detailed assessment and planning phase to develop more concrete estimates and approach.
