# One-Pager: Engineering Team Reorganization

## TL;DR
Reorganize engineering from functional teams (frontend/backend/mobile) to cross-functional product teams to improve delivery velocity.

## Problem
Current functional organization creates handoff delays. Features require coordination across 3 teams. Average feature delivery time: 8 weeks. Dependencies block 40% of sprint capacity. Teams optimize locally, not for customer outcomes.

### Cost of Doing Nothing
Delivery velocity will continue to decline as product complexity grows. Competitor ships features 2x faster. Customer satisfaction scores dropping (NPS: 32 → 28 over 6 months).

## Solution
Create 4 cross-functional product teams aligned to customer journeys: Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Monetization. Each team has frontend, backend, and mobile engineers. Teams own full stack for their domain.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Do Nothing**: Velocity continues to decline
2. **Hire more engineers**: Doesn't fix coordination problem; Brooks' Law applies
3. **Outsource mobile**: Loses in-house expertise; coordination still required

**Chosen**: Reorg to product teams—addresses root cause, no additional headcount.

## Goals/Benefits
- Reduce feature delivery time: 8 weeks → 4 weeks
- Eliminate cross-team dependencies for 80% of features
- Improve team autonomy and ownership

## Scope

### In-Scope
- Team structure redesign
- Manager role reassignments
- Sprint planning process changes
- OKR alignment to new structure

### Out-of-Scope
- Hiring or headcount changes
- Office seating arrangements (remote-first)
- Compensation changes
- Title/level adjustments

## Success Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Avg feature delivery time | 8 weeks | 4 weeks |
| Cross-team dependencies per sprint | 12 | 3 |
| Team NPS | 28 | 40 |

## Stakeholders
- Owner: VP Engineering
- HR: Change management support
- Product: Domain definition
- Affected managers: Transition planning

## Timeline
- Week 1: Announce change, gather feedback
- Week 2: Finalize team assignments
- Week 3: Manager 1:1s with transitioning engineers
- Week 4: New team kickoffs
- Week 5-8: Transition support and retrospectives

## Investment
- HR/Change management support: $20K (external consultant)
- Manager training: $10K
- Productivity dip during transition: ~2 weeks reduced output

## Risks
- Engineer resistance: Transparent communication; address concerns
- Manager role ambiguity: Clear RACI for new structure
- Knowledge silos in old structure: Documentation sprint before transition
