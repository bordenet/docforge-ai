## Option A: Realistic Forge Scene (Recommended)

```
A modern, stylized blacksmith's forge scene with glowing orange-hot metal on an anvil, being shaped by a craftsman's hammer. Instead of a sword or horseshoe, the metal takes the form of a document or scroll with clean geometric lines. The forge glows with warm amber light against a deep blue-grey background. Clean, minimal tech aesthetic — not medieval fantasy. Subtle digital/circuit patterns integrated into the anvil's surface suggest AI assistance. Professional, sophisticated, suitable for a software project header. No text. Dramatic lighting with strong contrast. Isometric or slight 3/4 view. Style: modern vector art meets industrial design, similar to Stripe or Linear marketing imagery. --ar 2:1 --v 6
```

## Option B: Abstract Data Forge

```
Abstract visualization of document creation as metalworking: flowing molten data streams being shaped on a geometric anvil into clean, structured document forms. Warm forge colors (amber, orange) blending with cool tech blues. Sparks represented as code particles or data points. Minimalist, modern aesthetic suitable for a GitHub repository header. No medieval elements. Clean lines, subtle gradients, professional software branding style. --ar 2:1 --v 6
```

---

## Option C: Minimalist Icon Style

```
Minimalist flat illustration of a blacksmith's anvil with a glowing document being hammered into shape. Single line weight, limited color palette: deep navy, warm orange, and white. Geometric shapes, no gradients. Tech company branding aesthetic. Suitable for GitHub social preview. No text. Centered composition with generous negative space. --ar 2:1 --v 6
